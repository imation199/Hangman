        <h1>HangMan</h1>
        <h3>Short History.</h3>
        <p class="center">In 17th and 18th century Europe, criminals who were sentenced to death by hanging could demand the "Rite of Words and Life."<br>
            In the "Rite of Words and Life" a criminal to be hanged was strung up over a 5 legged stand, and a board with a series of short ropes representing a word was displayed. <br>
            The Executioner would pick the word, and would use charcoal to mark correctly guessed letters on the dashes of the board, and incorrect letters to the side. <br>
            At every incorrect guess the executioner would use a sledge hammer or axe to knock away a single leg of the stand. 5 wrong guesses, and the criminal was hanged. <br>
            If the entire word was filled in correctly or guessed, the condemned would be set free from that sentence and not tried again on that crime.<br>
            The irony here was that almost all of those criminals were illiterate.Either way, we have preserved that old tradition in our own small way.</p>
